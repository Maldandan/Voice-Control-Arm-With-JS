# Voice Control Arm With JavaScript

In this project, I have used HTML and JavaScript for speech recognition application! just as in a previous project of mine, except this time I have added a new function to connect to Arduino and use voice commands!

In this example, robotic arm is being used, and some key words are used to give the Arduino the command to send signal and control the different servo-motors of the robotic arm.
